# JavaScript Frontend Projects 🚀

This repository contains my **JavaScript frontend projects** that I am building while learning web development.  
The goal of this repo is to **track my progress**, practice core JavaScript concepts, and gradually move from **basic logic to more complex, real-world projects**.

Each project increases slightly in difficulty and focuses on strengthening my understanding of **JavaScript, DOM manipulation, events, and UI behavior**.

## 🧠 What I am learning through this repo

Through these projects, I am actively learning and practicing:

- JavaScript fundamentals (variables, loops, functions)
- Arrays and objects
- Random number generation
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Input validation
- Updating UI dynamically
- Working with images using JavaScript
- Basic HTML & CSS for layout and styling
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

This repo represents my **hands-on learning journey**, not just final polished apps.
